# mbox

The project I used for tracking my bank account ([smoneybox.com](https://smoneybox.com/)) was closed on May 1, 2022. So I either migrate my data to similar on-line service, or create a tool that I can run locally and that offers features I care about the most:
* import of CSV transaction files (created with [jtbanka2mbox](https://github.com/roman-kaspar/jtbanka2mbox) tool)
* the overall balance for the whole bank account (since the account beginning, or for provided period)
* the per-category balances (since the account beginning, or for provided period)
* list of transactions (overall + per-category; last N + provided priod + all)
* export of transactions into a CSV file

### Tech

The plan is to create a command-line tool that works with local SQL database, and simple command-line query client that will handle the above requirements. I want to use TypeScript and SQLite3.

### Data formats

The import / export **CSV files** are of the following format:
* Date: _string_, date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, e.g. "2022-05-01"
* Category: _string_
* Amount: _string_, in fixed two decimal digits format, e.g. "5679.73"

Exported files contain only listed columns, imported files must contain at least the above columns, all other column are ignored.

The **DB schema** is tracked in `migrations` directory, the schema contains the following tables:
* categories: (id, name)
* transactions: (id, category_id, date, amount)

All _ids_ are generated + autoincremented, the _name_ and _date_ are of TEXT type, and _amounts_ are of INTEGER type.

### Building

To build the project, you run
```
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

Compiled scripts are in `dist` directory, you need node version 16 or newer to run the code, to start it run
```
$ ./bin/mbox
```
with the arguments needed (see below).

### Supported commands

The following commands are supported:
* help
* init_db
* import
* balance
* list
* export

For details, use `help` command.
